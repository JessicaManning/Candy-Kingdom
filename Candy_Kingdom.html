  <p> <strong>Candy</strong>, also called <strong>sweets</strong> or <strong>lollies</strong>, is a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confectionery">confection</a> that features <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar">sugar</a> as a principal ingredient.</p>

  <p> The category, called <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confectionery#Sugar_confectionery">sugar confectionery</a></i>, encompasses any sweet confection, including <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate">chocolate</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_gum">chewing gum</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_candy">sugar candy</a>. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be <em><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candied_fruit">candied</a></em>.</p>

  <p> Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_substitute">sugar substitutes</a>. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert">dessert</a> course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.</p>

  <p> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantteri">Pantteri </a> is a soft, chewy Finnish sugar candy. The colored ones are fruity, while black are <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salty_liquorice"> <i lang="ang">salmiakki</i> </a>(salty liquorice-flavored).</p>

<h2> History </h2>

<p>Between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people"> Persians</a>, followed by the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks">Greeks</a>, discovered the people in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> and their "reeds that produce honey without bees". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture.[2] Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, while the word sugar is derived from the Sanskrit word <i>Sharkara</i>.[3] Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient India and consumed as <i>Khanda</i>, dubbed as the original candy and the etymology of the word.</p>
